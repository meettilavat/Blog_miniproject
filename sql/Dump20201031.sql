Instead of sharing that list at Sony&rsquo;s website, Ubisoft flagged the titles on its own website &mdash; but it appears that list may have been inaccurate, and the company has now taken it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have pulled the Ubisoft Connect article and forum post regarding backwards compatibility for the time being as there may be inaccuracies involving the Ubisoft titles that will be playable on PS5,&rdquo; an Ubisoft spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em> in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to taking down the post, Ubisoft claimed that the following nine games would not work on PS5:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Syndicate</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Chronicles Trilogy Pack</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Chronicles India</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Chronicles China</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Chronicles Russia</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Risk</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Werewolves Within</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Space Junkies</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Ubisoft tells us it should have the correct list of games next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>&ldquo;We have pulled the Ubisoft Connect article and forum post regarding backwards compatibility for the time being&rdquo;</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, these games do not appear on Sony&rsquo;s PS5 backward compatibility list, which currently has ten titles that Sony says will not work on the new console. In contrast, all of the Ubisoft titles released on the Xbox One will run on Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Series X and S consoles, according to the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sony previously said that the PS5 will support an &ldquo;overwhelming majority&rdquo; of PS4 titles with more than 4,000 games released on the console expected to be playable on the next-gen hardware, but they will come with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21509379/sony-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-games-support-features\">a few limitations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s most surprising is that <em>Star Trek: Bridge Crew </em>and <em>Space Junkies</em>, two PlayStation VR titles, are supposedly not backward compatible. Sony has already said that the PS5 will support the PlayStation VR, but you will need <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21538861/sony-psvr-camera-adapter-ps5-compatible-request-form-online\">a special adapter</a> to use the headset with the new console.</p>\r\n','2020-10-31 15:01:14','meet','image/5f9d7c3a811e8.webp'),(12,'2020 F1 Portuguese GP race results','Lewis Hamilton won the Portuguese Grand Prix for Mercedes at Portimao in Portugal, round 12 of the Formula 1 World Championship, and his 92nd F1 victory surpasses the all-time record of the legendary Michael Schumacher.','<p>&nbsp;From pole position, Hamilton held the lead off the startline with Red Bull&rsquo;s Max Verstappen jumping past Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) into second at Turn 1, but Bottas fought back, pushing him wide at Turn 3. Verstappen then clashed with Sergio Perez, sending the Racing Point spinning down to last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With spots of rain falling, Hamilton struggled for grip and Bottas passed him for the lead a few corners later. Bottas led the opening lap but McLaren&rsquo;s charging Carlos Sainz caught and passed him for the lead, as the McLaren seemed to have no issues in firing up its soft tyres in the slippery conditions, while Mercedes toiled initially on mediums. Verstappen fell back to fifth, but soon passed Lando Norris in the second McLaren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottas used DRS to reclaim the lead from Sainz at the start of Lap 6, and Hamilton followed suit a lap later as the rain stopped and Sainz began to complain of tyre graining. Verstappen and Ferrari&rsquo;s Charles Leclerc further demoted Sainz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamilton set a sequence of fastest laps to catch Bottas and passed him using DRS at the start of Lap 20, and subsequently pulled well clear out front. Hamilton was 10 seconds clear of Bottas when he pitted for the hard tyre with 25 laps to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite some further brief rain showers, Hamilton eased his way to a record-breaking victory, finishing well clear of Bottas, Verstappen and Leclerc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The McLaren v Racing Point constructors&rsquo; championship fight escalated as Norris and Stroll clashed at Turn 1, Lando sending Lance spinning after the latter&rsquo;s bold bid to pass him around the outside. Both cars sustained wing damage and fell to the rear of the pack, with Stroll getting a 5s time penalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez saved Racing Point&rsquo;s day with an amazing comeback drive from his opening lap spin, but the choice of running softs in the final stint came back to bite him in the closing laps, as Gasly passed him for fifth place with two laps to go. Sainz mirrored the move on the final lap, to grab sixth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez finished seventh, ahead of the Renaults of Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo. Sebastian Vettel claimed the final point for Ferrari.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>F1 Portuguese Grand Prix race results</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Cla</th>\r\n			<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n			<th>Driver</th>\r\n			<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n			<th>Chassis</th>\r\n			<th>Engine</th>\r\n			<th>Laps</th>\r\n			<th>Time</th>\r\n			<th>Gap</th>\r\n			<th>Pits</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td><a href=\"https://www.motorsport.com/driver/lewis-hamilton/1278/\"><img alt=\"United Kingdom\" src=\"https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/static/img/cf/gb-2.svg\" style=\"height:12px;

I don&rsquo;t need to list the reasons. But one of the few bright spots has been the world of video games. From <em>Animal Crossing</em> helping folks stay connected during the pandemic&rsquo;s early days to Travis Scott performing a virtual concert in <em>Fortnite</em> to politicians streaming <em>Among Us</em> on Twitch, games seem to be everywhere. They&rsquo;re embedded in just about every aspect of our culture. Not all of this is new, of course, but it&rsquo;s been accelerated by the current state of the world, where virtual spaces are becoming as necessary as real ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, you could say that now is the best possible time to pick up gaming as a hobby. From the sheer breadth of experiences that are available to the simple fact that more people are playing than ever before, video games have never been so accessible and so broad. And with new consoles on the way from both Sony and Microsoft, the medium is looking to change and expand even more very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are 10 reasons why gaming is better than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You don&rsquo;t have to spend a cent to play great games</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I always thought I had it good growing up. In the &lsquo;90s, my parents&rsquo; PC let me play huge chunks of games like <em>Commander Keen, Jill of the Jungle, Scorched Earth, Castle of the Winds, Raptor: Call of the Shadows,</em> and <em>EGA Trek</em> without paying a cent, and I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike\">a free mod for <em>Half-Life</em></a> become one of the most popular games in the world. But the shareware and modding scene I remember has <em>nothing</em> on the cornucopia bestowed on gamers today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the year the biggest <em>Call of Duty</em> ever made is a free battle royale game. <em>Fortnite, Valorant, Apex Legends, Spellbreak,</em> and <em>PUBG Mobile</em> are all titans of multiplayer that you don&rsquo;t have to pay for. MOBAs are the same; <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Smite,</em> and <em>Heroes of the Storm</em> don&rsquo;t make you buy in. <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>Gwent</em>, <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, and <em>MTG: Arena</em> let you sling cards for free, while <em>Warframe</em> and <em>Dauntless</em> scratch that sword-swinging itch. And <em>Pok&eacute;mon Go</em> is <em>still</em> one of the biggest games in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:63342/miniproject/image/50272117098_4902e671b7_k.webp\" style=\"height:563px; width:1000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just made-for-microtransaction games that forgo the initial spend: huge games just past their prime are now going free as well. <em>Destiny 2</em> is free. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452630/rocket-league-free-to-play-10-coupon-epic-games-store\"><em>Rocket League </em>is now free</a>. <em>StarCraft II</em> and <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> went free a few years ago. Increasingly, large chunks of MMOs like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <em>EVE Online</em>, and <em>Star Wars: The Old Republi</em>c are free-to-play, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But my favorite free games are the full-fat titles that Epic, Ubisoft, and other PC platforms are handing out like candy with no strings attached. I own full copies of <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Odyssey</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> simply because I <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146914/google-project-stream-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-copy-ubisoft\">played a Google demo</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322923/ubisoft-watch-dogs-2-free-pc-forward-deal-uplay-account\">watched a Ubisoft stream</a>. Meanwhile, Epic is using its <em>Fortnite</em> fortunes to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam\">give a mountain of PC games away</a>. We haven&rsquo;t even counted all of the free weekends and weeks where you can download and try an entire game on Steam or Uplay or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506259/steam-autumn-game-festival-2020-indie-developers\">the Steam Festivals that come with hundreds of free indie game demos</a>. If your internet and home network is strong, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121996/nvidia-geforce-now-2-0-out-of-beta-rtx\">Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now</a> will give you a free virtual PC for an hour at a time that you can play free games on. It&rsquo;s the ultimate cheapskate move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And recently, a couple of truly epic cross-platform games have been free right out of the gate: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519507/among-us-twitch-sensor-tower-app-store-google-play-mobile-gaming\">the smash-hit social murder guessing game <em>Among Us</em></a> is free with ads on mobile, and the gorgeous anime fantasy adventure <em>Genshin Impact</em> seems to have largely been forgiven <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/21/18700922/genshin-impact-gameplay-beta-breath-of-the-wild-clone-botw\">for cloning portions of <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, thanks to a richly detailed world... which, again, you can explore on phones or PCs free of charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this rate, you could stop paying for games tomorrow and never run out of things to play. <em>&mdash; Sean Hollister</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Subscription services are turning gaming into Netflix</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Game subscription services like Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Game Pass and Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation Plus Collection have made it a lot easier for me to justify the costs of a next-gen console. Instead of having to buy a console <em>and</em> a $70 game (or two or three) just to have something to play on day one, I can plug the consoles in, log into my $9.99-per-month Game Pass and PlayStation Plus accounts, and pick something to play from the wealth of fantastic options available on each service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, the monthly cost for those services is a much more economical way to play games. I love being able to try something that interests me without having to worry about paying full price and regretting it later. And I don&rsquo;t usually play games more than once, so eventually losing access to a game if or when I stop subscribing isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>These services have so many games to play</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the services have <em>so many games to play</em>. The PlayStation Plus Collection for the PlayStation 5 has 18 of the PS4&rsquo;s best games. PlayStation Now has more than 800 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games you can play on your PS4 and PC. Xbox Game Pass has more than 100 titles and will get all future Microsoft first-party titles on release day (a deal that&rsquo;s all the sweeter with Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x\">recent acquisition of Bethesda Softworks&rsquo; parent company</a>). And EA, Ubisoft, and Apple all have their own game subscription services, each packed with games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a console? Apple Arcade is a similar service, offering a buffet of premium mobile games &mdash; some of which are exclusive &mdash; for $4.99 per month. After more than a year of existence, Arcade now boasts some truly great experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paying for one month of any of those subscription services gives me access to more games than I could ever reasonably expect to finish in a timely manner. They&rsquo;re finally starting to live up to their potential of being something like Netflix for gaming. And their single-month subscription costs are a heck of a lot cheaper than $70. <em>&mdash; Jay Peters</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VR is steadily finding its place</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality is not the mainstream format that the hype around the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR might have led you to expect all the way back in 2016. There are still huge barriers for a lot of people to overcome before they&rsquo;ll want to commit. The technology is still expensive, you still have to wear a bulky headset, and in many cases, there are still fundamental game design issues to be worked out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you take a step back for a second and look at how the technology has evolved alongside the video game industry, VR is in an incredible spot right now. There are multiple commercial products that you can actually buy and have some seriously amazing experiences with. With my apologies to the developers of <em>Mario&rsquo;s Tennis</em> for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, that&rsquo;s never been the case before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:63342/miniproject/image/COMBINE_ELEVATOR_4K.webp\" style=\"height:563px; width:1000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sony generally did a good job with PlayStation VR, turning in a simple-but-effective product and supporting it with a solid flow of content. Valve&rsquo;s SteamVR push resulted in the high-end Index headset and the fantastic <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>. And Facebook&rsquo;s Oculus Quest, particularly the new second model, has struck by far the best balance of technology and accessibility to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are certainly questions remaining over where the VR industry will go in the future, not least regarding Facebook&rsquo;s stewardship of the Oculus ecosystem. You may well have entirely valid reasons for not wanting to get on board with VR yet, or even ever. It&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I carry out a bombing run on a Star Destroyer in <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em> or run through <em>Rez Infinite</em> for the 300th time or eke out my highest score yet on a Linkin Park song in <em>Beat Saber</em> while really hoping that no one&rsquo;s watching, it&rsquo;s hard not to feel like VR is an essential part of the gaming landscape today. It might not be the future of everything, but it&rsquo;s uniquely exhilarating in ways that would otherwise be impossible. <em>&mdash; Sam Byford</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The biggest games are more than just games</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On a typical Saturday, I might get up early to catch a few <em>League of Legends </em>Pro League matches broadcast from Shanghai and maybe squeeze in a few rounds of the collectible card game <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> as I watch. Later in the day, I&rsquo;ll listen to the latest single from K/DA or catch up on <em>League</em>&rsquo;s lore-heavy short stories. Before I know it, hours have passed. The wildest part is I don&rsquo;t actually play <em>League of Legends</em> &mdash; but there are so many other ways to interact with its vast universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>There are more entry points for people</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is increasingly becoming the case for the world&rsquo;s biggest games. Titles like <em>League, Fortnite, Minecraft,</em> or <em>Overwatch</em> are much more than just games. They&rsquo;re short films and TV shows, comic books and novels, sports and live-streaming entertainment. The actual game is just one part of the overall experience. This means that for the most hardcore fans, you can really dig deep and become invested in your favorite games. You can play <em>Overwatch</em> and watch the <em>Overwatch</em> League and read Tracer comic books, and it all ties together. You can spend the hours you aren&rsquo;t playing<em> Fortnite</em> watching your favorite streamer play it on Twitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it also means that there are more entry points for people. I may not enjoy playing<em> League</em> all that much, but it&rsquo;s fun to watch high-level competition, and I&rsquo;ve become increasingly enamored with its vast lore. Turns out, I don&rsquo;t need to play it at all to explore all of that. Even an extremely nerdy strategy game turns into something very accessible when it&rsquo;s part of a vast entertainment universe. <em>&mdash; Andrew Webster</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The dream of cloud gaming is so close</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud gaming, in which you stream games from a faraway server to whatever screen you have in front of you, is poised to change pretty much everything about the game industry. That&rsquo;s if, like viral reality, the technology can find its footing when it becomes more than just betas and hype. And the companies trying to make cloud gaming a reality have some very tricky technical and economic issues to iron out before we get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most important right now is that no one company quite knows the best way to sell cloud gaming. There are now numerous competing models for how games will be priced and distributed in a future where consumers don&rsquo;t own them but rent them from the cloud instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft has the strongest idea yet with Xbox Game Pass and xCloud bundled together, giving subscribers an ever-growing library of titles to stream but only to Android devices for now. Also holding up xCloud&rsquo;s wider adoption is Apple, which won&rsquo;t let cloud gaming services like Microsoft&rsquo;s on the iOS platform. Then there&rsquo;s Google Stadia, Amazon&rsquo;s Luna, Sony&rsquo;s existing PlayStation Now service, and Nvidia GeForce Now, among other smaller services from lesser-known companies. Even Facebook is taking small steps into the field. And each has its own particular approach, with no platform offering a true holy grail &ldquo;Netflix for games&rdquo; quite yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the promise is exciting &mdash; and that&rsquo;s why so many companies want a piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:63342/miniproject/image/vpavic_xcloud_20201009_0011_Edit.webp\" style=\"height:750px; width:1000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine a world where you can start a game on your game console, pick it up later on your more powerful PC, and then have your save file carry over to your iPad or Android phone when you&rsquo;re on the go. Even more radical is a world where very few gamers own any hardware at all, choosing instead to stream almost everything like we do with television today through whatever screen we have handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kinds of experiences perfect for that screen-agnostic reality don&rsquo;t really exist right now. But games like <em>Fortnite</em> and services like Xbox Game Pass are giving us a glimpse of what it&rsquo;s like when hardware fades into the background and it&rsquo;s just the games and the software that manages them in the cloud that matter. And it&rsquo;s genuinely exciting, even if it feels like we&rsquo;re still a few years away from seeing the first real benefits these cloud platforms can provide. <em>&mdash; Nick Statt</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Crossplay and cross-platform experiences make things more accessible than ever</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few years ago, the idea of getting to play cross-platform games with people on other consoles seemed like a pipe dream. But if 2019 was the year that proved that crossplay between different platforms was possible, 2020 saw it fully enter the mainstream as the new norm for multiplayer games going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Games like<em> Star Wars: Squadrons</em> launched with full-fledged cross-platform multiplayer on day one; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496885/apex-legends-cross-play-beta-launch-ps4-xbox-pc-compete\"><em>Apex Legends</em></a> is adding crossplay soon, <em>No Man&rsquo;s Sky</em> added support over the summer, and Bungie is already working on true cross-platform play for <em>Destiny 2,</em> too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>It&rsquo;s great for players and for games</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s <em>Fortnite</em>, which is still the gold standard for cross-platform experiences. <em>Fortnite</em> on PC is the same as <em>Fortnite</em> on Xbox or PlayStation as it is on your Android device. (Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402888/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-update-iphone-ipad-mac-battle-pass\">iOS no longer fits into this paradigm</a>.) All of your progress, unlockable items, and new content syncs across all those versions of the game, and players can play with friends on any platform at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s no small thing, either. It&rsquo;s great for players: it lets you play your favorite games with your friends, even if one member of your group bought an Xbox instead of a PS4. With the increasing emphasis on long-term live games that can see players invest dozens, if not hundreds, of hours into a single title, it means that player progression isn&rsquo;t tied into just a single platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossplay is great for games, too. It means that multiplayer lobbies are fuller, with bigger, healthier communities that can sustain games for far longer than the siloed-off player bases of the past. And with next-generation consoles on the way, things are looking even brighter, with some games promising not just cross-platform play between, say, Xbox and PlayStation, but cross-generational play, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video games are better when everyone can play together. And now, with cross-platform play finally a reality, everyone can. <em>&mdash; Chaim Gartenberg</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nintendo continues to go its own way</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s role over the past couple of decades has often been as a foil to Sony and Microsoft &mdash; to provide something different rather than to compete directly. Sometimes that goes very well, as with the DS and the Wii, and sometimes it goes like the Wii U. But with the wildly successful Switch, it feels like Nintendo has found an approach that could set it apart for the next decade or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core idea &mdash; it&rsquo;s a regular game system, but it&rsquo;s also a portable, and it works &mdash; is one anyone can get behind if they ever travel, or share a house with another TV viewer, or own a bed. The Switch is so compelling that people clamor for almost every game that could plausibly run on the device to do so. Nintendo&rsquo;s own first-party output has been consistently strong on the Switch, with new entries in series like <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em> rocketing through sales records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:63342/miniproject/image/jbareham_180418_2442_0093.webp\" style=\"height:667px; width:1000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And by basing its latest home console around mobile technology that allows it to be used as a portable, Nintendo has a clear runway to improve the Switch. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that it&rsquo;s based around an Nvidia chip from 2015 and that there&rsquo;s still room for clear, tangible gains without resorting to a $500 mega-box like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox Series X. A more powerful version is rumored for next year, and while Nintendo is not known for pushing cutting-edge technology, the Switch concept is solid enough to warrant at least a few more upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the weird, experimental Nintendo that relied on quirky hardware? You still get that on the Switch with projects like the cardboard Labo sets, the workout RPG <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, and most recently, the AR-powered <em>Mario Kart Home Circuit, </em>all of which use external accessories to transform the device. The beauty of the Switch&rsquo;s core simplicity is that it can be whatever Nintendo wants it to be. And if you want something more than that, well, soon enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to step into theme parks of Nintendo&rsquo;s own creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Wii and the DS were hugely successful, they were always going to be limited in terms of long-term appeal. That&rsquo;s not the case with the Switch &mdash; it&rsquo;s a slam-dunk product that will define Nintendo for the foreseeable future. And even at less than four years old, there&rsquo;s a strong case to be made that it&rsquo;s Nintendo&rsquo;s best console yet. <em>&mdash; Sam Byford</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PC gaming is in a great spot</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>PCs are also setting the stage for the next generation of games, thanks to some new GPUs and CPUs. Nvidia unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review\">RTX 3000 Series of graphics cards</a> recently, and the RTX 3080 is more than capable of delivering 4K games at high frame rates. We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of big performance promises for the RTX 2000 Series of cards in the past, but it feels like Nvidia is finally delivering a jump that will help push PC gaming closer toward 1440p as the standard and 4K at the high end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>PCs are also setting the stage for the next generation of games</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nvidia isn&rsquo;t alone in its PC gaming efforts, either. AMD revealed new Zen 3 processors recently that will help boost frame rates, and the company also launched its RX 6000 series of GPUs. AMD promises that its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics\">new Radeon RX 6800 XT</a> will go head to head with Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3080, and it&rsquo;s priced $50 cheaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these leaps in performance mean many existing and midrange cards will certainly get cheaper, as retailers seek to offer discounts on PCs bundled with older cards. If you&rsquo;re still stuck on a 1080p display and a GTX 1060 graphics card, it could be a great time to upgrade for a host of new games that are arriving in the next few weeks and well into 2021. <em>&mdash; Tom Warren</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Games have become de facto social spaces</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaming has become much more mainstream over the last decade, and many of the biggest games have been cleverly disguised as social hubs that let you stay connected with your friends and family. It is beautiful to see people I knew when I was younger, who I would have never expected to play video games, jump into these experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:63342/miniproject/image/Switch_ACNH_OctUpdate_screenshot__1_.webp\" style=\"height:563px; width:1000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Games like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview\"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>have blown up and provided escapism during the pandemic</a>. I log in on Facebook and see people I went to high school with buying a Nintendo Switch just to play this one game. They use it to build or strengthen friendships in various ways, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21213923/animal-crossing-new-horizons-turnip-prices-sell-exchange-profit\">trying to conquer the stalk market</a>. I&rsquo;ve even made new friends, and we would build rapport and bond over our mutual interest in a particular video game. Experiences like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21473602/among-us-downloads-discord-app-record\"><em>Among Us</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game\"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> are simplistic yet entertaining, making them appeal to such a broad audience. They&rsquo;re also games that are at their best when played with friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been a firm believer that games are for everyone, regardless of the circumstances. Today, new games come out consistently that validate that belief. The difference is they&rsquo;re more than just games &mdash; many of them have become de facto social hubs that help me stay connected with friends and even make some new ones. <em>&mdash; Taylor Lyles</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Twitch and YouTube have changed how we experience games</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Games aren&rsquo;t just games anymore. This has been happening for a while &mdash; the elevation of video games beyond the bounds of their platforms, I mean. There were always discussion boards and message boards where games could and did live. But now, as the walls of the internet have collapsed and their denizens have been loosed upon each other &mdash; like Tumblr users fleeing a porn ban move to Twitter, let&rsquo;s say &mdash; games have become mass culture. (There was also Gamergate, which has replicated and situated itself in American political life.) <em>Animal Crossing</em> became a legitimate viral hit early this year, way back in the early days of the still-ongoing pandemic; last year, <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> spawned an avalanche of memes. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that games and pop culture are now synonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>Frictionless sharing is what made the world we&rsquo;re living in</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partially, that has to do with the influence of YouTube and Twitch, which have always been a natural home for video games. And they&rsquo;ve expanded how we can think of them, too, from the video essayists who deconstruct the tropes and mechanics of your favorite games to the streamers who manage to entertain while showing off a game you&rsquo;ve heard about but haven&rsquo;t actually played. These new-ish creators have never been more popular or more influential. I find that development pretty useful: there are <em>so many</em> video games, and I&rsquo;ve found that there is a gap between the games I want to watch and the games I like to play. Video helps bridge it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sony launched the PlayStation 4 in November 2013, the designers made the fascinating decision to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20998610/playstation-4-ps4-share-button-social-play-sony-25th-anniversary\">ditch the traditional &ldquo;start&rdquo; and &ldquo;select&rdquo; buttons on the console&rsquo;s controller in favor of &ldquo;options&rdquo; and &ldquo;share.&rdquo;</a> It&rsquo;s the latter button that helped send streaming into the mainstream; suddenly, it didn&rsquo;t take obscure technical knowledge to broadcast yourself playing the things you liked. Frictionless sharing is what made the world we&rsquo;re living in. Facebook&rsquo;s guiding principle is that connecting with people is de facto<em> </em>good, which is absolutely untrue. But the site took over the internet anyway and remade everything else in its image. Gaming, like everything else, has followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next generation of consoles is on its way, and each will have robust sharing features built into its system architecture. They&rsquo;ll be all-in-one machines and worlds, I think, we&rsquo;ll never feel like we have to leave &mdash; perfect, scale replicas of the internet itself.<em> &mdash; Bijan Stephen</em></p>\r\n','2020-10-31 16:00:12','meet','image/5f9d8a0c5fb80.webp');

INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (22,'meet','Apple today announced its fiscal fourth quarter earnings, reporting $64.7 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.73 in a quarter that was “led by all-time records for Mac and services,” according to CEO Tim Cook.\r\n<br>\r\nLike last quarter, Apple’s Mac and iPad lines showed strong performance as people continue working and learning from home due to the continued COVID-19 pandemic. The Mac had its biggest quarter ever, tallying $9 billion in sales.\r\n<br>\r\nApple introduced the latest iteration of its entry-level $329 iPad in September, increasing the device’s performance. The mid-tier iPad Air got a more significant makeover with a new design — now matching the iPad Pro — and a much faster processor. iPad sales were up 46 percent from the year-ago quarter.\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike in recent years, and because the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro didn’t go on sale until mid-October, these earnings don’t include a jolt of early sales for Apple’s latest smartphones. As a result, iPhone sales in the quarter were soft. But the Q4 numbers do include early sales of the Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE, which launched in September. The iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 mini will go up for preorder on November 6th and start shipping a week later.\r\n<br>\r\nApple has ceased providing guidance or earnings forecasts over the last two quarters due to uncertainty around the pandemic. That has continued today, as Apple isn’t giving any guidance for the quarter that will end in December, either. So the company isn’t offering up any clues for how big it expects the iPhone 12 upgrade cycle to be.\r\n<br>\r\nThe company will launch its “Apple One” bundle of subscription services tomorrow, combining Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, and added iCloud storage for a single monthly price. A “premier” tier adds in Apple News Plus and the upcoming Apple Fitness Plus service. Apple One will start at $14.95 per month for an individual plan or $19.95 for a family plan. Apple One is expected to further propel the company’s already-booming services division, which earned $14.5 billion in revenue this quarter.\r\n<br>\r\nApple is widely expected to announce its first Mac computers powered by the company’s own silicon in November, which will kick off a transition away from processors made by Intel. Apple announced the move during its Worldwide Developers Conference back in June and distributed a development kit to help app makers prepare for the big switch. Old apps designed to run on Intel hardware will continue to work by way of Apple’s Rosetta 2 software.
